# Observations made during programming

## 2024 Day 1

Things that felt clumsy compared to earlier C# attemts:

- string split creates an empty line that needs to be ignored
- If I was to use Object.groupBy instead of the ImmutableJS equivalent, my keys
  would end up being strings even though they were numbers to begin with
- What about Map, what about making a helper for Map.map or Object.map...
